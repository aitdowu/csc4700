What is your favorite movie? - The Wolf of Wall Street

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be? - Greece

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)? - I would have super speed, but not like the Flash --
more like Dash from the Incredibles, so that I could be justtttt faster than everybody else and win a bunch of awards and break world records,
while still keeping my powers under the radar.
