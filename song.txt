You too good to be true, you like Actavis, ayy, yeah
Me and you did the coupes, why look back again?
Tell me something, I start poppin' them blues like all on accident, yo

Yeah, yo, what you say gotta be true, that's my rap again
(You know I fuck with you, you know you mad confused, you know)
Huh, ayy, ayy, all these niggas hate, all I show is love, ayy
Fuck that bitch, she gotta be sick, that's why she hit me up, ayy
Got my mama Googling lean, keep sendin' me kidney stuff, ayy, ayy
Ho, you know I'm dead, why you hit me up?
Fuck that bitch, I'm 'bout to be rich, that's why she hit me up, ayy
I chuck B's in the SRT like I'm with Nudy and 'em
Me and Saw Money, bitch, I hold the species, say we dirty niggas, ayy, ayy
Too good to be true, you like Actavis, ayy, ayy
Play me like a fool, but you'll be back again, yeah
All this money on lean, should've been a VVS
I fixed that ho self-esteem, now she wanna see me dead, yeah, yo
